# SecretSanta
Automated Secret Santa name picker selects two gift recipients for each participant using Arduino and RFIDs. 


This project uses an Arduino Nano, RFID reader, RFID tags (I used ones designed for laundry and shaped like buttons), and a custom designed 3D printed housing and display that fits inside a sturdy cardboard gift box.
